It's THE app I use for work. I made it because our platform has poor UX leading to losses in efficiency. When your solution hinges on solving pressing issues in real time, seconds are at a premium. You can see the comparison here.

On the right side, is BeyondTrust, the app we use at work to answer real time chats. 
To make the prompts come out, you have to click the very tiny arrow.

If you didn't see it, well, that's part of the problem isn't it? Per client, you have click at least 3 times
and scroll just to use the most common prompts. It is a practical impossibility when 4 chats pop out at the same time.

https://greatvaluemacropad.netlify.app/ is my macropad. It has 4 options which cover 90% (I use it everyday) of all chats.

In this test session with a friend, you can see how quick and simple it is to use. You just press the button and it copies the prompts and I just paste it in the chat.

1. Last clicked item stays RED so I easily confirm visually what I copied last. This prevents pasting the wrong prompts in a high volume environment. 
2. Yellow for hover (same reason above). 
3. Black text on yellow hover (instead of white) for easy readability. 
4. Blue has high contrast with yellow/red options and fades with background so my eyes zero in on either red or yellow. 
5. Off-white background so it doesn't feel like staring at the sun.
6. I made a design choice not to go with 70-75ch per line so it retains the [macropad](https://www.tindie.com/products/dekuNukem/duckypad-do-it-all-mechanical-macropad/) feel. On the left is a macropad, on the right is a piano key with 70ch.

# Notes: 


- There are no hotkeys because 1 hand is always close to or on a mouse. If you like hot keys, there is  [beeftext](https://beeftext.org/) available.
- I probably could have gone with plain purple background but I decided to be fancy. 
- I made this before we learned react so it is all vanilla js, html, and css.
- In my opinion, it is currently feature complete, however there now a demand for new features since other people started using it.

## No mobile because all our workflow is desktop.
